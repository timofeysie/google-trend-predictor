# Which ML model to use

## The decision tree model

Initially ChatGPT recommended training a Decision Tree Classifier model

Whether a data set is suitable for training a Decision Tree Classifier model depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, the quality and quantity of the data, and the specific problem or task you want to solve.

Looking at the example data set you provided, it seems to be a time series data set for different search trends, with each entry representing a specific trend along with related search terms and a sparkline showing the trend's popularity over time.

To determine if this data set is suitable for training a Decision Tree Classifier model, consider the following points:

Data Quality: Ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and representative of the trends you want to classify.

Feature Engineering: Consider if the features in the data set are appropriate for the classification task. In this case, you mentioned adding the "IsMajorTrend" boolean flag, which could be a relevant feature for classification.

Data Size: Evaluate the size of the data set. Decision trees tend to perform better with larger datasets, so make sure you have enough data for training and testing.

Class Balance: Check if the classes are balanced in the data set. Imbalanced classes may affect the model's performance and may require additional techniques like class weighting or resampling.

Model Evaluation: Decide on appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier.

Model Interpretability: Decision trees are inherently interpretable models, making it easier to understand and interpret their predictions.

## time series forecasting models

For predicting incremental growth in search interest over time, you can consider using time series forecasting models. Time series forecasting is a specialized branch of machine learning that deals with predicting future values based on historical data points ordered by time.

Some of the commonly used time series forecasting models for predicting incremental growth include:

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA): ARIMA is a classical and widely used time series forecasting model. It combines autoregression, differencing, and moving average components to model the time series data. ARIMA is suitable for data with a clear trend and seasonality.

Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA): SARIMA extends ARIMA to handle seasonality in the data. It is appropriate for time series with seasonal patterns.

Prophet: Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is designed to work well with time series data that has strong seasonal effects and multiple seasonalities. It can handle missing data and outliers effectively.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks: LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in time series data. LSTMs are suitable for data with complex temporal patterns and can handle variable-length sequences.

Gradient Boosting Trees: Gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM can be used for time series forecasting tasks. They can handle non-linear relationships and have been proven effective in many time series applications.

The choice of the best model depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, the amount of historical data available, the presence of seasonality, and the complexity of temporal patterns. It's essential to experiment with different models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Additionally, feature engineering is crucial in time series forecasting. You may want to include lagged variables, moving averages, seasonal indicators, and other relevant features to enhance the model's predictive power.

## The nature of our dataset

Given the nature of your data and the task of predicting which trends will become major trends based on sparkline data, using time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, or Gradient Boosting Trees may not be the best approach. Instead, this task seems more suitable for binary classification using machine learning algorithms.

Since you have labeled data indicating whether a trend becomes a major trend or not (the "isMajorTrend" attribute), you can use supervised learning algorithms for binary classification. Here are some machine learning models that you can consider for this task:

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.

Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to make the final decision.

Gradient Boosting Classifier: Gradient Boosting is another ensemble learning method that builds multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) sequentially, with each new tree correcting the errors of the previous one.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a powerful algorithm for binary classification tasks. It tries to find the best hyperplane that separates the two classes.

Neural Networks: You can also try using neural networks, such as a simple feedforward neural network or a more complex deep learning architecture, to perform binary classification.

To proceed, you'll need to prepare your data by extracting relevant features from the sparkline data. These features could include statistical measures like mean, variance, or trends over specific time intervals. Additionally, you can engineer features based on the "titles" data to capture the relationship between the trend title and the major trend outcome.

Once you have your data and features ready, you can split it into training and testing datasets and then train the selected machine learning model on the training data. After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC.

Remember to handle any class imbalance in your dataset, as major trends might be relatively rare compared to non-major trends. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights can help address this issue.

Ultimately, the choice of the best model will depend on the characteristics of your data and the specific performance metrics that are most important for your prediction task. I recommend starting with simple models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest and then experimenting with more complex models as needed.

## Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Between Logistic Regression and Random Forest, Logistic Regression is generally easier to get started with, especially for binary classification tasks like the one you described (predicting whether an object will become a major trend or not). Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification, and it provides interpretable results, which can be useful for understanding the impact of different features on the prediction.

Here's a high-level outline of how you can proceed with using Logistic Regression for your task:

Data Preprocessing:

Convert the "isMajorTrend" field into binary labels (e.g., 0 for not a major trend, and 1 for a major trend).
Extract relevant features from the "titles" and "sparkline" fields to use as input for the model. You may need to perform feature engineering, such as converting text data into numerical representations (e.g., using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings) and processing the sparkline data.
Data Split:

Split your dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.
Model Training:

Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data. You can use popular machine learning libraries in Node.js such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.js for this purpose.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test set using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
Making Predictions:

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new data, such as the object you provided in your example.
Model Improvement:

If the performance of the Logistic Regression model is not satisfactory, you can consider trying more advanced models like Random Forest or other machine learning algorithms.

## Logistic Regression with TensorFlow.js

Please show me the functions that can be used within Nest.js to perform Logistic Regression with TensorFlow.js on my dataset.

```sh
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node
nest generate service logistic-regression
nest generate controller logistic-regression
```

To train the model, send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/logistic-regression/train with the following JSON data in the request body:
json

```json
{
  "trainData": [
    [0, 1],
    [1, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [0, 0]
  ],
  "trainLabels": [0, 1, 1, 0]
}
```

The training code controller looks like this:

```js
  @Post('train')
  async trainModel(
    @Body() data: { features: number[][]; labels: number[] },
  ): Promise<void> {
    const { features, labels } = data;
    if (
      !Array.isArray(features) ||
      !Array.isArray(labels) ||
      features.length === 0 ||
      labels.length === 0
    ) {
      throw new Error(
        'Invalid input data. Both features and labels must be non-empty arrays.',
      );
    }
```

The training service looks like this:

```js
  async train(trainData: number[][], trainLabels: number[]): Promise<void> {
    const xs = tf.tensor2d(trainData);
    const ys = tf.tensor1d(trainLabels);
    await this.model.fit(xs, ys, { epochs: 100 });
  }
```

To make predictions, send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/logistic-regression/predict with the following JSON data in the request body:

```json
{
  "features": [
    [1, 1],
    [0, 0],
    [1, 0]
  ]
}
```

The predict controller looks like this:

```js
  @Post('predict')
  predict(@Body() data: { features: number[][] }): number[] {
    return this.logisticRegressionService.predict(data.features);
  }
```

The predict service looks like this:

```js
  predict(features: number[][]): number[] {
    const inputs = tf.tensor2d(features);
    const predictions = this.model.predict(inputs) as tf.Tensor;
    const predictedLabels = Array.from(predictions.dataSync());
    predictions.dispose();
    inputs.dispose();
    return predictedLabels;
  }
```

The API should respond with the predicted labels for the new data points.  It looks like this:

```json
[
    0.7843161225318909,
    0.5,
    0.5536770224571228
]
```

This example uses a very simple dataset with only two features. For our datasets, we will need to perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
