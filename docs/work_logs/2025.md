### Possible Investigation Steps

- Check CloudWatch Logs (if enabled)
- Look at nginx access/error logs through AWS Systems Manager
- Check Docker container health metrics
- Monitor memory usage over time
- Set up better logging/monitoring for future incidents

### Questions to Answer

- When exactly did this start happening?
- Are there any patterns in the timing?
- Does it correlate with specific API calls?
- Is memory being leaked by Puppeteer/Chrome processes?

#### Check CloudWatch Logs

```sh
PS C:\Users\timof\repos\node\google-trend-predictor> aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name "/aws/ec2/google-trend-predictor"

An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the CreateLogGroup operation: User: arn:aws:iam::100641718971:user/zappa-deployer is not authorized to perform: logs:CreateLogGroup on resource: arn:aws:logs:ap-northeast-2:100641718971:log-group:/aws/ec2/google-trend-predictor:log-stream: because no identity-based policy allows the logs:CreateLogGroup action
```

The manual approach via the website consists of:

- Create Log Group in the CloudWatch Console
- Create named EC2CloudWatchLogsRole IAM role and attached it to the EC2 instance.
- EC2"Actions" → "Security" → "Modify IAM role" Select EC2CloudWatchLogsRole and click "Update IAM role"

Failed to start the instance i-06c4272926b9ef33c
The instance 'i-06c4272926b9ef33c' is not in a state from which it can be started.

Apparently stopping takes about five minutes.  Trying again later works.

When updating the Docker file, since ssh is not working, I need another way to connect.  But the ec2 serial console shows this warning:

*This instance type is not supported for the EC2 serial console. To connect to the serial port of an instance using the EC2 serial console, the instance must use an instance type that is built on the AWS Nitro System. You can change the instance type to a supported virtualized instance type or bare metal instance type.*

## CloudWatch Logs

The API stopped working again today.

There are no log streams in the /aws/ec2/google-trend-predictor log group on CloudWatch.

I had to add the CloudWatch configuration to the Docker run command:

```sh
# Run Docker with CloudWatch logging
docker run -d --rm -p 3001:3001 --init \
  --log-driver=awslogs \
  --log-opt awslogs-region=ap-southeast-2 \
  --log-opt awslogs-group=/aws/ec2/google-trend-predictor \
  --log-opt awslogs-create-group=true \
  google-trend-predictor
```

Then the logs work, and also, the EC2 instance is also now working.

## Let's Encrypt Certificate Expiration

I received an email from Let's Encrypt saying that the certificate is expiring.

Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 6 days (on 2025-03-30). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your web site will encounter errors.

```sh
# Check certbot version
certbot --version

# Renew all certificates
sudo certbot renew

Congratulations, all renewals succeeded:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.mcayreserve.com/fullchain.pem (success)
```

The current API call: https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance is showing this error:

```err
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance' from origin 'https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

This was previously working.  It took a while to migrate the other Django backend app to a new db, but now that is done, this backend is not working now for some reason.

Doing: curl -I -X OPTIONS https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data

Shows this result:

```sh

Trouble shooting steps:

1. check the actual GET request headers:

```sh
curl -v https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance
```

Shows this result:

```

The GET request is working and returning data correctly! However, I notice something important - the response headers for the GET request are missing the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, even though it's present in the OPTIONS response.
The response headers from your GET request show:

```txt
< X-Powered-By: Express
< Vary: Origin
< Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
< ETag: W/"1c29-qzWzb+PxBzsvpbucJ6T4ZImuQfc"
```

But it's missing:

```txt
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com
```

This is why the browser is blocking the request - the CORS headers need to be present on both the OPTIONS and the actual GET response. Let's modify the nginx configuration to ensure the headers are added to all responses:

After that, this is the error:

```err
create:1  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance' from origin 'https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header in the response is 'true, true' which must be 'true' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'. The credentials mode of requests initiated by the XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute.
```

We have a different CORS error - we're getting duplicate Access-Control-Allow-Credentials headers again, but this time it's likely because both nginx AND your Express backend are setting CORS headers. Let's fix this by:
First, let's modify the nginx configuration to remove any CORS headers coming from the Express backend:

```sh
server {
    server_name api.mcayreserve.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

        # Keep timeouts
        proxy_connect_timeout 60;
        proxy_send_timeout 60;
        proxy_read_timeout 60;
        send_timeout 60;

        # Remove any CORS headers coming from the backend
        proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin';
        proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods';
        proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers';
        proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials';

        # Add CORS headers at nginx level
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com' always;
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS' always;
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range,Authorization' always;
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true' always;

        if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
            return 204;
        }
    }
}
```

This fixes the issue, but it seems redundant to do this when the backend can be changed. 
What is the best practice for setting the CORS headers?

I suppose for a production Environment:

- If you have a single frontend origin: Handle at nginx level
- If you need dynamic CORS rules: Handle at application level
- If you have multiple applications: Consider handling at nginx level for consistency
