## Waiting for selector `feed-item` failed

```sh
=== /process-data API called
puppeteer page ready
Error while scraping: TimeoutError: Waiting for selector `feed-item` failed: Waiting failed: 30000ms exceeded
```

The page is using a custom web component (c-wiz) which is part of Google's modern web architecture. Let's update the selector strategy to handle this structure. Here's the modified code:

## Auth

I have a Django Rest Framework app that communicates with a React frontend which also has to use this projects APIs.  I want to be able to share the auth from that project to protect these routes using that same auth.  That DRF app has these INSTALLED_APPS:

```py
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    'rest_framework',
    'django_filters',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'dj_rest_auth',
    'corsheaders',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'dj_rest_auth.registration',
    ...
```

### Auth Guard

implement a custom authentication guard in NestJS that validates the tokens issued by the DRF application.

Verify token with your Django backend

```js
const response = await axios.get(
  'http://your-django-api/api/auth/verify/', // Adjust this URL to your Django verification endpoint
        {
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Token ${token}`, // or `Bearer ${token}` depending on your setup
          },
        }
);
```

The DRF app uses this API to authenticate the user:

```txt
Request URL: https://drf-two-eb17ecbff99f.herokuapp.com/dj-rest-auth/token/refresh/
Request Method: POST
```

We use a JWT guard to validate the token from your DRF app. Here's how to update it.

## Heroku Deployment

```sh
heroku create google-trend-predictor

heroku buildpacks:add jontewks/puppeteer -a google-trend-predictor

# Add Puppeteer buildpack
heroku buildpacks:add jontewks/puppeteer

# 2. Add Node.js buildpack
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
```

### Update your package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/main.js",
    "postinstall": "npm run build",
    "build": "nest build"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.20.0"
  }
}

### Modify your google-trends.service.ts

### Add Procfile

```Procfile
web: npm run start
```

### Deploy

Using the new deployment in the frontend fails:

```txt
https://google-trend-predictor-445bdeb27571.herokuapp.com/parse-realtime-data
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 503 Service Unavailable
```

To view the logs, on the app Heroku Dashboard "More" menu in the top right select "View logs" from the dropdown.

```

### Remove existing buildpacks

- Go to your app's Settings in Heroku Dashboard
- Scroll to "Buildpacks" section
- Click the "X" next to each existing buildpack to remove them all
- Add buildpacks in this specific order: the official nodejs and then jontewks/puppeteer buildpacks.

### Update your Procfile to use node directly

```Procfile
web: node dist/main.js
```

### Update the package.json to use node directly

```json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "node dist/main.js",
```

### Build Timeout Expired

```sh
-----> Installing dependencies
       Installing node modules
-----> Timed out running buildpack Node.js
 !     Push failed
ERROR: Build terminated for reason: Build Timeout Expired```
```

### Move Development Dependencies

Update your package.json to move testing and development tools to devDependencies:

Go to Settings → Config Vars and add:

```txt
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION: false
NODE_ENV: production
```

This still does not work.

### Reduce the build time significantly

- create a .npmrc file in your project root
- Update your package.json to include only the essential dependencies
- Remove NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION

I'm starting to doubt if it will even be possible to deploy this app with Heroku.

One option would be to add an expensive Dyno type to increase the build timeout.

- Standard-1X ($25/month): 30 minute build timeout

I think that might be a good idea, but in general experience with Heroku is not really something that will improve my profile.

AWS or Azure would.  However, how much am I willing to pay for this feature?

Like the Satisfactory app which was only run locally, it might just be something I run on my laptop, and I give up the flexibility of using the feature on my phone "out in the field" so to speak.

Satisfactory is a monorepo with specific Python ML requirements and various front ends, and would have required considerable skills and experience to deploy.

Even after working with Django and Tensorflow, I was able to deploy such an app on AWS EC2 instances, but at a cost I was not willing to pay ($100 a month or thereabouts).

Maybe there is a separate approach that just involves curating the links needed that can be used on a phone to whip up a more manual workflow might be a more cost effective solution.

Another options would be to create an Docker image that can be deployed to an EC2 instance for a period of time when it's in use, and then removed when its not.

This would demonstrate some hirable skills as well as be a cost effective solution.

Its not idea, but until a platform can start to make money or be funded in some way, its not worth pouring money into.

## Docker image

- create a Dockerfile
- Create .dockerignore
- Build and test locally

First I launch the Docker app on my Windows machine.

Check its running and then build.

```sh
$ docker --version
Docker version 26.0.0, build 2ae903e
$ docker build -t google-trend-predictor .
$ docker run -p 3001:3001 google-trend-predictor
```

```sh

```

The error is because the sources.list.d directory doesn't exist.

To fix this we Add a ```mkdir -p /etc/apt/sources.list.d``` to create the directory and fix the path to ```/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list```.

Then, the build takes forever:

### Docker error

Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error
An unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command.

Either shut down WSL down with wsl --shutdown, and/or reboot your machine. You can also try reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop. If the issue persists, collect diagnostics and submit an issue⁠.

It seems I am not able to uninstall docker desktop due to McAfee Framework Host (service).  when I choose "kill aopplications", the same window pops up again.  Refresh doesn't help.  Why is my virus protection showing up in this operation?

Even when running computer management as admin, it says access is denied when I try to uninstall the service.

I am also unable to turn off the scanning service which is blocking the uninstallation.

Apparently this is a common issue with McAfee's self-protection feature, which prevents even administrators from stopping its services directly.

I gave up on trying to uninstall docker and restarted my system and ran docker again and went through the build and run process and guess what?  It worked!

Now I can proceed to deployment.

### Docker Workflow

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker image 
docker image prune -a
docker build -t google-trend-predictor . --progress=plain
docker run -p 3001:3001 google-trend-predictor
```

### Container Shutdown if Ctrl+C doesn't work, in a new terminal

```sh
docker stop <container_name>
```

### Clean Up Before Rebuilding

```sh
# Remove stopped containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Remove unused images
docker image prune -a

# Or for a complete cleanup (including volumes and networks)
docker system prune -a
```

### Rebuild and Run

```sh
# Build with no cache (when you've changed the Dockerfile)
docker build --no-cache -t google-trend-predictor .

# Run with proper shutdown signal handling
docker run -p 3001:3001 --init google-trend-predictor
```

## CORS issues

```err

This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

GoogleTrends.js:54  Error fetching trends: Error: Network Error
    at createError (createError.js:16:1)
    at XMLHttpRequest.handleError (xhr.js:99:1)
```

This is a browser security feature. When a page is served over HTTPS (your Heroku frontend), it can't make HTTP requests (your EC2 backend).

We have two options:

1. Set up HTTPS on your EC2 instance (recommended for production):
   - Get an SSL certificate (can use Let's Encrypt)
   - Configure nginx as reverse proxy
   - Update EC2 security groups for port 443

2. Quick fix for testing (not recommended for production):
   - Add this meta tag to your frontend's HTML head:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests">
```

So the next step is to set up an SSL certificate on the EC2 instance.

However, testing with option 2 causes this error:

```err
GoogleTrends.js:35      
GET https://ec2-52-65-222-223.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3001/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR
```

Since we are using EC2 directly (without a domain name yet), we would need to configure nginx as a reverse proxy to solve this.  But may as well get a domain name at this point and do it properly.

Using AWS Route 53 + ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)

- Register domain through Route 53 (~$12-15/year for .com)
- Free SSL certificate through ACM
- Automatic certificate renewal
- Seamless integration with AWS services
- Best for AWS infrastructure

Just not today.  I have work to do.

## Domain Name & setup

I already have an unused domain name: mcayreserve.com

I requested a certificate with AWS Certificate Manager.

In the CNAME records section I choose "Create records in Route 53".

Next I set up your EC2 instance with the new domain name.

### Create A Record in Route 53

- Go to Route 53 → Hosted zones → mcayreserve.com
- Click "Create record"
- Set up

```txt
     Record name: api  (this will create api.mcayreserve.com)
     Record type: A
     Value: [the EC2 IP]
     TTL: 300
```

### Update EC2 Security Group

- Add new inbound rule:

```txt
     Type: HTTPS
     Protocol: TCP
     Port: 443
     Source: 0.0.0.0/0
```

This brings the total to three inbound rules now, one for SSH, one for port 3001 and now one for HTTPS

### Install and Configure nginx

```sh
sudo yum install nginx -y
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf
```

Add this configuration:

```sh
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name api.mcayreserve.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.mcayreserve.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.mcayreserve.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Remember to remember how to save and exit in nano:

- Ctrl + O    (to Write Out/Save)
- Enter       (to confirm)
- Ctrl + X    (to Exit)

- Update the frontend code:

```js
export const axiosNest = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.mcayreserve.com",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  withCredentials: true
});
```

- Update backend CORS in main.ts:

```ts
app.enableCors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com',
    'https://api.mcayreserve.com',
    process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  ].filter(Boolean),
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true
});
```

But after all that, this is what we get:

```txt
Request URL: https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance
Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

Nginx is not running.

```sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-7-104 google-trend-predictor]$ sudo systemctl status nginx
○ nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; disabled; preset: disabled)

```

Try to start it:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl start nginx
Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status nginx.service" and "journalctl -xeu nginx.service" for details.
```

Check the reason:

```sh

```

This is because we haven't installed the SSL certificate from ACM to the EC2 instance yet. Let's modify the nginx configuration to start without SSL first.

```sh
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.mcayreserve.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Then try again:

```sh
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

We will switch to certbot for now.

```sh
sudo certbot --nginx -d api.mcayreserve.com

$ nslookup api.mcayreserve.com
Server:         172.31.0.2
Address:        172.31.0.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   api.mcayreserve.com
Address: 52.65.222.223
```

On my Windows machine:

```sh
curl http://api.mcayreserve.com
curl : Unable to connect to the remote server
At line:1 char:1
+ curl http://api.mcayreserve.com
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (System.Net.HttpWebRequest:HttpWebRequest) [Invoke-WebRequest], WebException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletWebResponseException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand
```

 This suggests a security group issue.

 I have to add a rule for HTTP so that lets encrypt can verify the domain.

```sh
   Type: HTTP
   Protocol: TCP (auto-fills)
   Port range: 80 (auto-fills)
   Source: 0.0.0.0/0
   Description: Allow HTTP for Let's Encrypt verification
```

The flow will be:  Internet -> Port 443 (HTTPS) -> nginx -> Port 3001 (Your Node.js API).

But now the API call failes like this:

```txt
Request URL: https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data?geo=US&hours=24&category=all&type=all&sort=relevance
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 200 OK
Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

I think we need to add timeout settings:

```sh
proxy_connect_timeout 60;
proxy_send_timeout 60;
proxy_read_timeout 60;
send_timeout 60;
```

sudo systemctl restart nginx

```err

On the frontend I added explicit Origin header, change withCredentials to false and skip adding authorization header for the trends endpoint.

But none of this was working.  Then Claude-3.5-sonnet says this:

*I notice you're running your app in Docker. This changes things - we need to make sure nginx can reach your Docker container.*

This is scary because this whole conversation has been about using Docker.

I ask Claude what I can do to avoid this problem in the future.

*I sometimes fail to maintain context across the entire conversation. Let me suggest some best practices for working with me:*

It's advice is:

- Start with Context Summary
- When starting a troubleshooting session, you could say something like: "We're working on a dockerized NestJS app deployed on EC2 with nginx as reverse proxy. Previous context: [key points]"
- Reference Previous Decisions
- When making changes, remind me: "Remember we decided to use Docker for deployment. How does this affect [current issue]?"
- Challenge Inconsistencies
- Like you just did - if I seem to forget important context, please point it out immediately.
- Keep Track of Key Decisions

Maintain a brief list of important decisions/configurations we've made during the session.

- Would you like to:
- Start fresh with a clear summary of our setup?
- Continue with the CORS issue but with proper Docker context?

I suppose with AI that is handling things beyond my normal expertise, it's difficult to challenge Inconsistencies.

### Debugging the CORS issue

Check if the CORS headers are actually being sent

```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Method OPTIONS -Uri "https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data" -Headers @{
    "Origin"="https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com"
    "Access-Control-Request-Method"="GET"
} -UseBasicParsing


curl -i -X GET "https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data" \
  -H "Origin: https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"

docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=google-trend-predictor) --tail 100
```

I see this:

```sh
$ curl -v -X GET "https://api.mcayreserve.com/parse-realtime-data" \
  -H "Origin: https://dot-one-26b272efdbb8.herokuapp.com"

```

After finishing all the changes above, the CORS issue appears solved and the call from the API completes in the frontend.

The explicit CORS configuration in NestJS was important.
